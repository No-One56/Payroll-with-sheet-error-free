DEAR FRANCES,http://www.dearfrances.com,apparel & fashion,12,United Kingdom,,+44 750 089 0160,James,Durrant,Logistics Manager,http://www.linkedin.com/in/james-durrant-8a456590,james@dearfrances.com,4.4754E+11,"As one of the fastest growing new designer labels in the world, Dear Frances is a luxury fashion brand selling globally in luxury department stores and specialist boutiques including Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Harvey Nichols, Galeries Lafayette, Lane Crawford and Ssense. Founded with the clear objective to bring luxury designer classics directly to modern women, all while slowing the fashion cycle and leading the way for socially conscious businesses.
We work closely with our team of artisans in Italy, utilizing sustainable materials and processes to develop a new luxury - a luxury that seeks to slow the fashion cycle, a luxury that focuses on craftsmanship and a luxury that helps to increase the integrity of our fashion choices. Our core collection focuses on the timeless wardrobe, where modern minimalism takes centre stage with sleek textures, architectural silhouettes and refined details. Strong and elegant, we find empowerment in essential shapes and tonal hues that form the basis of a classic wardrobe. We are energised by designs we can invest in now and wear forever. And we are inspired by versatile shapes that we find ourselves reaching for time and again.
Dear Frances shoes have been worn by Margot Robbie, Gigi & Bella Hadid, Kendal & Kylie Jenner, Kaia Gerber, Hailey Bieber, Selena Gomez, Zoe Kravitz, Emma Roberts and Sienna Miller.The brand has been featured in publications including Vogue, The New York Times, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, InStyle, Elle Magazine, W Magazine, Business of Fashion and others.
We believe that good shoes make you look and feel great. Over 900 million people around the world live in extreme poverty and most of those people don't have access to adequate footwear. To help address this problem, we partner with non-profit organizations like Soles4Souls to help provide shoes to those in need.
