Over 42,000 contractors signed up in the 131 largest metro areas in the US, servicing 49 states. This intangible asset alone is worth over 1M solely based on the cost one would incur signing up this many contractors to a new platform. This business is highly profitable with great margins. The worker database is currently able to accommodate 30x the current customer volume, which means all you need is marketing to scale.The business generates customers through 3 avenues:1. Organic: The company owns 19 Google my Business Profiles with over 3000 combined reviews (4.8 star average) We have the best and most reviews in the industry! The company owns 2 main websites and owns 11 DBA websites.2. Word of Mouth: The company has great word of mouth traction. An estimated 20% of all business comes from word of mouth referrals. Our independent contractors provide quality services at the best prices in the industry, and our clients are almost always happy and tell their family and friends!Craigslist: We advertise on Craigslist. (pretty sophisticated huh;)These 3 avenues constitute our entire marketing effort and strategy. Someone with a marketing background can grow the customer base and revenue exponentially, practically overnight. We currently do not market with Google ads or Facebook ads, because we do not know how!To be frank, we the owners do not have the time, the energy, or the know how to grow the business much beyond what it is today. We believe strongly in this business, what it represents, and the value it brings to both our clients and contractors. We really want to see our baby in good hands and taken to the moon by the right individual, family office, or PE firm.The business has the potential to be the “Uber of home services, moving and labor”. Being TRULY nationwide has it's benefits and there is a huge opportunity to partner with, and be a vendor for a variety of large corporations, notably self storage REITS and last mile logistics companies. We've had meetings with a couple of the large US REITS and most of them are interested in us being either a vendor for them or a partner with them due to this strength of ours. The benefit we provide them as a vendor is we are able to service all of their locations. Right know they have individual vendors for individual locations and it drives their maintenance departments crazy making different phone calls and sending different emails for each of their hundreds of locations!Interested parties please reach out via e-mail. Those that reach out expressing interest will receive an NDA to sign. Parties that sign the NDA will receive the CIM and financials, and have the opportunity to have a management meeting with us (the owners) upon request.The business is currently somewhat interest rate dependent, and fluctuates between 500k and 800k SDE depending on where interest rates are. This is because 70% of our current business is moving labor and more homes are bought and sold when interest rates are lower. Whether interest rates are currently high or low we will not change the valuation, because right now with 1 hour work per week we bring in 500k-800k SDE per year. With the intangible asset valued at over 1M- worst case scenario the buyer is getting a 4x valuation based solely on cash flow.Owners are seeking a buyer with cash, or their own financing. We are not interested in SBA buyers.The owners are seeking to roll over minority or majority equity. The owners are seeking a buyer who is growth oriented, who wants to and has the vision and the skillset to help scale the business 100x +.","$3,300,000","$1,944,516","$820,000","$2,000",,42.17%,4.02,,,,Zeeshan

They have secured elusive vendor agreements with Luxottica, a privilege unavailable to new online retailers. These agreements allow them to offer top brands like Oakley, Nike, Ray-Ban, and many others. Additionally, the companies maintain an exclusive partnership with a government lab, enabling them to obtain the industry’s lowest lens costs.This competitive advantage, combined with their drop-ship model that minimizes inventory holding costs, has enabled the businesses to maintain strong profit margins and generate healthy cash flows.The owners have built a strong and capable team to handle day-to-day operations, ensuring a smooth transition for the new owner. This will allow the buyer to capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities, such as growing the lucrative corporate accounts segment, expanding into untapped marketing channels like affiliate and influencer marketing, and strategically increasing inventory to reduce turnaround times.After successfully growing the businesses, the owners are now looking to sell as they shift their focus to larger ventures and spend more time with their young children. They believe a new owner with fresh energy and a growth mindset will be ideal to take the companies to new heights.Since 2010, this pair of ecommerce businesses has built a strong reputation in the Online Prescription Safety Glasses and Eyewear market. With 14 years of proven success, these businesses consistently meet the high demand for eyewear, generating recurring revenue and high profit margins.Following a strategic pivot toward profitability in late 2023, the businesses have maintained healthy quarterly revenues between $890K and $960K. Their competitive advantage stems from exclusive partnerships with Luxottica and a government lab, which provide industry-leading lens pricing. Combined with an efficient hybrid drop-ship model, these partnerships enable a 53% gross profit margin, consistently outperforming competitors.A recent website redesign and brand refresh have significantly improved customer experience and conversion rates, with overwhelmingly positive feedback on the shopping experience. Currently, the corporate program represents 12% of revenue and has a three-year average customer retention rate, indicating strong growth potential. Additional growth opportunities include affiliate marketing, influencer collaborations, and inventory optimization to decrease turnaround times.With minimal owner involvement (20 hours weekly) and a skilled team managing daily operations, the business is well-positioned in a market projected to grow 8.5% annually through 2030. This stable foundation and multiple growth avenues present an excellent opportunity for a buyer to expand upon an established and profitable business.Key Benefits:Proven Longevity: The companies have over 14 years of success in the $8.5B Prescription Eyewear market and a strong brand reputation, demonstrating the evergreen demand for their products.Profitable and Scalable Business Model: The businesses operate on a hybrid drop-ship model with exclusive vendor partnerships, maintaining 53% gross margins and healthy cash flows.

Galveston Golf Carts was established in 2019 by my son and myself with the dream of simply renting golf carts on the beach in shorts and flip-flops. With three locations and 85 golf carts for rent, we get to wear our shorts and flip-flops... we work a lot during the season.. The work season is from February til September and relax the other months. Yes.. it's a seasonal business! There's plenty of room for growth for the company with sales and service of other people's golf carts. The rental side of the company is completely set-up and can be expanded with rentals off the island. We only take credit cards (no cash for several reasons) and have good book keeping. We get along with all the landlords and are allowed to stay as long as we want and we keep paying rent. There are leases for all locations. We're trying to figure out where the next location will be, but it's not an easy task..
We have other things we want to do and are ready to start something new. I have a serious medical condition that is the main reason for moving on.
You have to be hands on and work this business. Especially if you want to expand the business.
It's a simple and fun business and the customers are always appreciative. There's always festivals on the island and the cruise ship industry is expanding with a newly finished cruise terminal another terminal in the works.
Galveston Motorcycle Rentals and that can be added to this deal.
We will NOT owner finance.
We will NOT wait on you to get financing.
We do have P&L statements for the last three years
If you are serious. Plan on coming down to Galveston to meet and take a look at everything.
Thanks for your interest

This is a unique opportunity to acquire a low-maintenance, strong-margin Amazon FBA brand with immediate paths to growth through multi-platform expansion and bulk-ordering cost reductions of 10%–15%.

Launched in 2022, the brand has rapidly established itself in the Home, Kitchen, and Storage niche, building a portfolio of 17 SKUs that consistently garner exceptional customer feedback, evidenced by over 3,150 product reviews averaging 4.5 stars on Amazon.

The business operates with remarkable efficiency, requiring only 4–8 hours of weekly oversight through a well-documented system of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and an established team. The brand's efficient marketing generates a healthy 3.0 return on ad spend (ROAS) on Amazon advertising with a $9.85 customer acquisition cost while maintaining a notably low 2.36% return rate.

Immediate growth opportunities abound for a new owner. The business is positioned for rapid expansion into alternative Amazon marketplaces with existing US inventory. Bulk ordering opportunities could reduce the cost of goods sold by 10%–15%. Additionally, a robust product development pipeline stands ready to launch.

The sellers are being pressured by their families to join the family real estate business and end ecomm pursuits for now. The business's market position is well-protected through trademark registration and strong supplier relationships. Operating in an evergreen product category with consistent demand, the company maintains competitive advantages through its premium positioning and superior customer satisfaction, commanding above-average Amazon pricing while maintaining strong sales velocity.

Due to the sellers’ desire for a quick sale, the asking price is below market value and we are seeking cash buyers. SBA buyers will not be entertained.

Key Benefits:

Evergreen Niche: People will always be searching for home kitchen options.

Strong Financial Metrics: The brand features strong margins, with consistent gross margins of almost 70% and net margins of over 20%.

Efficient Operations: A streamlined 4–8-hour weekly management requirement, documented SOPs, and an established team structure that is ready to continue under new ownership ensure a smooth transition and immediate operational stability.

Proven Marketing Efficiency: The company’s 3.0 ROAS on Amazon advertising and $9.85 customer acquisition cost show efficient ad spend and room for scaling while maintaining profitability.

Quality Product Portfolio: The brand lists and sells 17 SKUs with over 3,150 positive reviews.

The boat is perfect for private charters which is what is selling best. . Owner financing is available with 50% down. One important note; there is a new hospital managed by a Canadian hospital chain that you will find has excellent services and since you are required to sign into the health plan; you will find it very comforting that there is treatment locally at a reasonable monthly payment; a very big plus and reassurance for immediate health needs..p.s. You may be confused that the boat tour business is listed as located in the Caribbean (Turks & Caicos Islands) and the address is Florida, This was the only way I could complete the listing since the form would not allow an island address due to no zip code.. I Just added water basketball. To view the five minute action video just go on our site and the video is easy to find.. Look for ocean outback adventure tour which does not show the waterbasketball I mentioned since it was just added. Also find the video on my website oceanoutback.tc The boat is sooo much fun.and there is no other like it in these islands which gives me an exclusive advantage. I get so many inquiries and bookings since everyone wants to be on the ""floating playground."" I have had queries about if you need a captain's license to run the boat, YOU DO NOT and it is sooo easy to operate. There is a requirement to take a course on firefighting; first aid and lifesaving (CPR).The three day course is STCW I have fine-tuned the tour so it involves little effort and so much fun to do. I believe you will find the operation being one of the easiest to take over and the boat being aluminum is maintenance free To replace the boat I was quoted over 1 M and was built to U.S. Coast Guard standards with 10 watertight compartments so very seaworthy. I see very few BBS listings that offer such a turn-key operation with great return and little investment The boat also has a glass bottom feature and was built by a well-respected commercial company in Naples Florida. The builder is Belle Craft. now inactive.. .
The tours are streamlined and soo easy to operate. Just switch on the batteries and go. At the end of the tour all you need to do is wash down the decks; take empty fuel containers. trash and remaining food; that's it so no stress or labor-intensive Even the cruising area is protected and in 10 ft. of water. I love it!!!! You will find it hard to discover another great ""turn-key"" operation if willing to relocate to paradise. Read the Mar-Jun 2024 issue of a local info magazine....wherewhenhow.com and there is a feature story on pages 64 & 65 also our two page advert is on 54 & 55.
""You only live once"" so why let this great business opportunity pass you by? It would be a shame to realize one day that you did not go for it. I always advise guests on my tour that I have not had a bad day yet! How can you when you wake up every morning for 38 years and the suit you put on is a bathing suit. This lifestyle could be yours; I started this business with a dream and struggled to get it going and made many errors along the way.

Serviced Offices Business

This is a rare opportunity to acquire a very well-established serviced office business with a solid track record. Other names for the serviced office industry include “office business centers”, “shared offices,” “virtual offices,” “co-working” and “executive suites” being the historic name.
The serviced office business consists of revenues earned by providing services such as dedicated receptionists, administrative support, private offices, virtual offices, conference rooms, and meeting rooms to companies of all sizes.

Fueled by recent economic trends, the shared office and co-working movement, which has been building momentum for years, is skyrocketing. It’s also revolutionizing how, when, and where people work. Its’ spike in popularity mirrors the rise of the nation’s independent workforce and the hybrid working model.

Government data supports this trend. “Our overall economy is shifting toward small businesses, where there is net growth, resulting in increased demand for flexible office space,” says Andrea Foertsch, founder, and principal of Disruptive Space as well as author of a NAIOP Research Foundation study. “Freelancers and startups now have places to work other than their kitchens or neighborhood coffee shops. The energized, motivated sense of community that coworking offers has proven its value and caught on. Shared office providers are supporting small business growth as well as flexible shifts in the use of building space.”

The global serviced office market size will grow from 23.66 billion in 2023 to 27.74 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate of 17.2% according to The Business Research Company. The market consists of both independent operators and major players such as Regus, Servcorp and WeWork. Regus, for example, now known as IWG has over 4000 workspaces in over 120 countries serving over 8 million clients with revenues of 3.4 billion USD in 2022 and 4.2 billion UDS in 2023, the highest in its 35 year history.","$595,000","$525,718","$179,722","$161,900",,34.19,3.31,,,,Zeeshan

Do you have an entrepreneurial mindset? Are you seeking a lucrative, yet easy-to-manage venture? How about trucking?

Amplified Logistics LLC presents the perfect opportunity for active investors like you - our established ""Car Hauler Business Empire"". A turn-key operation in the thriving logistics industry, promising a safe, high-yield return on investment. Brace yourself to enter a business realm designed to generate a substantial net income of $3-4K weekly per truck.

The average truck and railer unit generates $3,000-$4,000 net income per truck per week (net of driver pay, fuel, insurance, etc). Below we have examples of both scenarios:

Gross Revenue: $1,600,000

4 Trucks @ $10,000 week gross = $40,000 is $160,000 per month or $1,600,000 per year assuming 10 months of operation.

Assuming net income of $3,000 per week @ 4 trucks you have $12,000 times 4 months = $48,000 per month. This is equal to $480,000 per year assuming 10 months of operation.

$480,000 is the annual cash flow
- - - - - - -
Gross Profit Margin:
The formula is (Net income ÷ Gross revenue) x 100 = Net profit margin %

($480,000 ÷ $1,600,000) x 100 = 30%

Therefore, the net profit margin per year is 30%.

________________

Gross Revenue: $1,600,000

4 Trucks @ $10,000 week gross = $40,000 is $160,000 per month or $1,600,000 per year assuming 10 months of operation.

Assuming net income of $4,000 per week @ 4 trucks you have $16,000 times 4 months = $64,000 per month. This is equal to $640,000 per year assuming 10 months of operation.

$640,000 is the annual cash flow
- - - - - - -
Gross Profit Margin:
The formula is (Net income ÷ Gross revenue) x 100 = Net profit margin %

($640,000 ÷ $1,600,000) x 100 = 40%

Therefore, the net profit margin per year is 40%.

The recent growth spurt in firm engagements creates a work load and compensation that unfolds over the next 6 to 36 months. Consequently, the value of the business tends to fluctuate. Municipalities are seeking solutions for economic recovery and growth, at a record pace.

Municipalities across the US face unprecedented challenges in economic development, including:

Realigning real estate to support future needs, housing, addressing new demographic needs, job development, budget issues, TIF opportunities, community impact, infrastructure, sustainability, and new capital resources.

Cities, villages, and townships have a substantial need to reach outside of their local resources, and DILIBERTO Municipal Advisors (DMA) is seeing firsthand the amount of work that needs to be accomplished

The growing demand for this niche of municipal advisor services has created outstanding growth opportunities for DMA. With over 35 years of experience assisting governments and corporations nationwide, DILIBERTO has established itself as a trusted partner. Now, another opportunity is upon DMA to share its experience beyond the currently serviced 12 states, increasing its reach to more than 40 states.

DILIBERTO’s corporate clients, including Intel Corp, BP, Jones Lang LaSalle, Allstate Life, and many others, benefit from a framework similar to that of local government. This alignment makes DMA an exceptional advisor for addressing corporate challenges at the government level.

With extensive experience serving diverse public, private, governmental, and institutional clients across the U.S., DMA’s expertise encompasses economic development, real estate, community and development planning, investment banking, and capital markets. But, perhaps the most significant differentiator is its unique collaboration of consulting strengths and capital resources to get the job done.

Fifteen years ago, (DMA) was established as a specialized branch of Diliberto Real Estate Services (DRES) to meet the increasing demand for municipal consulting services. Today, DMA is on a trajectory of exponential growth, positioning itself as a leading force in the sector. Engagement contracts anticipate an increase of a minimum of 100 municipal assignments across the US over the next 5 years, with a likelihood of over 1,000.

Private Capital Funds. The firm enjoys an innovative approach that injects new capital into cities and towns to support strategic development, key asset acquisition, business attraction, real estate realignment, and new demographics.

**Expanding Client Base & Growth Opportunities**

In addition to its municipal clients, DMA has continued interest from quasi-governmental entities, including public schools, power and water districts, housing authorities, and economic development organizations. By leveraging a strategic ""Bolt-On"" approach, DMA will benefit from future institutional acquisitions.

Geography. Using a national office-sharing model, the Chicago-based firm effectively delivers services throughout the U.S., making its solutions highly scalable.

The team boasts credentials from prominent organizations such as KPMG Corporate Finance, Bank of America, Accenture, Inland Real Estate Trust, public and private sector operations nationwide.

Operating in the booming $10 billion junk removal and moving industry, this business boasts a strong 8-year record of success. Though the seller's personal commitments and shifts in the real estate sector have hindered recent performance, the business has not maximized the use of the franchise’s cutting-edge technology to optimize operations. This presents a golden opportunity for a tech-savvy owner to enhance efficiencies and maximize potential. The franchise includes four trucks, 18 part-time employees, and all necessary tools for smooth operation from day one.

With a stellar 4.7-star rating from 742 Google reviews, the franchise has built a solid reputation but still has plenty of room to grow. The massive territory covers over a million people, ideal for tapping into the frequent moving needs of young professionals and businesses. Unlike new franchisees who start from scratch, you’ll step into a scale of opportunity that’s already well-established with high brand awareness, numerous referrals, and repeat business.

Marketing is on solid footing with a blend of digital and local advertising, but there is substantial room to expand through enhanced community networking and partnerships with local real estate agencies.
