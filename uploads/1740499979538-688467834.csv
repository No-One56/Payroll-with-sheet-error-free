Cebiche-Bar es un proyecto que se puso en marcha a mediados de Junio del 2012, abriendo por primera vez las puertas del Restaurant el 1ro de Octubre del mismo.
Este proyecto nace como respuesta a una necesidad de crecer y empezar a anclar frutos concretos en un ""pais de oportunidades"" despues de haber dejado con mucha nostalgia el ""pais de los sueños"".
Siendo la gastronomia peruana una de nuestras mayores cartas de presentacion y un motivo de constante facinacion personal, asi como de mi primo Carlos, no nos costó mucho decidirnos a entrar en una empresa completamente diferente a la del rubro en la que estabamos.
El interes principal es acercar a nuestros vecinos gringos, en este caso la comunidad de Pembroke Pines, nuestra muy personal vision de la experiencia culinaria peruana.
Tenemos que decirles que hasta el momento la respuesta ha sido increible y obviamente motivante!
Esperamos seguir creciendo en calidad, servicio y mas locaciones como fue concebido desde un comienzo!
Ya saben que cuando esten en La Florida a 25 minutos al norte de Miami tienen en nosotros a sus amigos para visitar y siempre con sabor a Perú.

It began as a bed and breakfast in 2004. There were only 4 rooms and a home cooked breakfast served daily.  Listening to the many guests, the theme we heard over and over was that they wanted to play and enjoy all that Put-in-Bay has to offer, but at the end of the day, they wanted to ‘go home.’  Home was often described as clean, quiet, tranquil and had all the ‘amenities’ that they have at home now.

We started to realize that there was a much-needed niche for a separate, unique and quiet hotel.  We didn’t want it to be just any hotel; and we were not interested in being a ‘traditional’ island hotel.  We wanted to have all the qualities of the original Anchor Inn.  It still had to be a clean, luxury-focused, quiet and comfortable place.  But we also knew we wanted something that wasn’t a mainstream hotel, and that was the beginning of the idea of a boutique hotel.

A boutique hotel is typically a one-of-a-kind hotel that is small and intimate, with non-traditional design, rooms, and presentation.  It has the independence of a bed and breakfast, but may be eccentric; often with a sense of humor.  This is the description of the Anchor Inn Boutique Hotel.

You won’t find a party hotel at this location.  There are no crowds here, no loud music, no slamming doors, and no noisy hallways.  We pride ourselves on providing a quiet and secure location without the party – the kind of place (like home) that you go to enjoy a nap, a good book, the company of friends, drinks on the patio and the beauty of an island sunset.

Our casually elegant rooms are the sweet spot of the hotel.  Each guest room or suite has been thoughtfully designed with handpicked elements and furnishings, a touch of whimsy and all the comforts of home – clean, quiet, tranquil and all the amenities you could want.

PetWorks,https://petworksonline.com/,,,,,Info@petworksmarket.com,1 727-954-4577,https://facebook.com/petworksstpetersburg/,"When our beloved seven-year-old Pomeranian, Nellie, suddenly died of kidney failure, no one could explain why. Sadly, we didn't know better and fed her crappy dog treats and kibble. That’s when we became interested in healthy alternative pet foods and supplies. So, we obsessed, researched, studied, interviewed and read everything we could about  the origins of ingredients, the deception of packaging, what ""natural"" really means, the companies behind the brands, and on and on.  What we discovered was shocking.  We learned that the material in toys and bedding could be toxic, there are toxins and dangerous ingredients in shampoos and deodorizers and pretty much everything.  Eating safe healthy food and avoiding ingredients that can't be pronounced, just like we do, can change your pets life and can likely even prevent illness so that we can enjoy them as long as possible. 

It became clear that our fur babies don't enjoy the same meager protection from the FDA that we do, so a holistic, truly natural approach to everything was needed....that's when PetWorks was born.

As animal lovers and current pet parents to CindyLou and Lana, we understand that your canines and felines are important members of your family – and how much you want to protect them. We also know the challenge of finding safe, natural, quality foods, supplements, toys, accessories and knowledgeable advice for your pets’ health and safety.

And that’s why we offer a range of premium, healthy and ethically sourced food products primarily from right here in the United States, and secondarily from countries with higher pet food standards, such as Canada and the European Union, to meet all the nutritional needs of your cats and dogs.

Since we’re focused on the mind, body and spirit of your pets, we also provide a variety of safe, toxin free toys, accessories and well care products sourced almost exclusively from the United States, with a handful of quality Canadian and European items, to help them live their best lives. We have done the research on every single product in the store, so you don’t have to.

We will never source any food products from China or other suspect source countries, nor will we allow any product with a questionable ingredient or poor safety history into our store. That is our promise to you!

Mountain Woods Furniture combines award-winning traditional design, innovative flair, artisan craftsmanship and heirloom quality. The company was founded in 1973 and is now the premier log furniture manufacturer in the US, with 200+ products and 4 distinct furniture lines: the core Heirloom Log Furniture Collection, the high-end Wyoming Collection, the affordable Rustic Arts Collection, and the rugged Aspen Grizzly Collection.

Founding Member, Sustainable Furniture Council


History

The story of Mountain Woods Furniture begins with one man's love of the art and craft of creating artisan log furniture, and continues over four decades of growth.

1973: Founder and president Tim Saltonstall built his first piece of rustic furniture just outside Laramie, Wyoming. Since then, every MWF piece is sourced from western woods (green, sustainable, reclaimed) and fashioned by artisan craftsmen who still create each piece by hand.

2001-2010: Owners Mike and Dee O'Connell led MWF through a decade of great change in the log furniture industry. They put the company in the forefront of the sustainability movement as a Founding Member of the Sustainable Furniture Council.

2011: Daryl and Maureen Joy acquired MWF after Mr. Joy visited the plant and ""fell in love with the quality"" of the furniture lines.

As President and CEO, Mr. Joy brings decades of experience operating a family-focused business to running a complex operation that encompasses sourcing renewable and reclaimed woods, an artisan industry, and sales to distributors and retailers through the US.

Their knowledge of form, balance, joinery and wood movement is evident in the pieces of fine furniture that still exist today. The clean line of the Shaker form inspires my designs, creating pieces with a modern flare and sized proportionally for today's needs. We use only solid hardwoods throughout each piece, always reading each board's grain pattern and figure to determine its best use in creating an attractive and functional piece of quality furniture. Pegged mortise and tenon as well as dovetail joinery is applied to every piece for a sturdiness that will allow it to last for generations to come.

We currently maintain a very comfortable business size that enables us the freedom to stay true to our focus: working closely with our customer. We are very grateful - (still no ties)!

Since our inception in 1998, our primary focus has always been about building relationships with our customers by offering exceptional customer assistance. We do that by knowing the products that we sell and understanding that customers have unique needs. We do not aspire to grow into a mega-huge internet retailer where it becomes impractical to really know all two million products for sale. Again, grateful we found something we can enjoy to do (without a tie)",home goods brands,,Abubakar

With an investment of $50 to purchase the remains of a garage sale (too good of a buy to pass up) and a lot of elbow grease, she opened Murphy Manor Antiques. It wasn't long before her ""Basement Boutique"" took over every room in the house. Her strong customer following caused the business to grow and expand. The business was moved to downtown Main Street in Hillsboro, which became Hillsboro Nostalgia Center. The business then evolved into the first Murphy's Furniture, which primarily focused on high quality, unfinished wood products at the best possible price. Incredible selection and customer service were always top priority. Murphy's Furniture continued to evolve to meet the growing needs of a constantly changing Western Washington County community. The store added new product lines, a full-service floor fashion center and a Pittsburg paint department. We tried several locations, until Mom bought property at our current location in Cornelius just west of Hillsboro on Southwest Tualatin Valley Highway.
With every change we learned from our experience and listened to our customers. We have maintained affordable quality selection of ready to finish furniture. Our largest line is locally manufactured and family owned Oakcraft Furniture specializing in solid oak and maple bedroom and home office. We carry an excellent selection of unfinished parawood, oak, maple, alder and pine as well as exotics like acacia, mango, and sheesham. We supply Restonic mattresses, a national brand of top quality mattresses sold at a reasonable price.
These are locally manufactured by Oregon Mattress, a family-run business of over 50 years. Our expansion of products to meet local needs also includes upholstered furniture, national brands like Best Chair and locally manufactured Stanton. ",home goods brands,,Abubakar

Our design philosophy is to follow the source wood's natural lines and contours, with a particular focus on revealing each piece's individual grain and edge. The result is contemporary hardwood furniture that highlights its organic origin. Designer and builder Steve Meschino sources, mills and dries each piece, then uses both hand tools and the highest quality joining and machining technology to create tables that are works of both art and nature.

Cherrywood Studio's furniture is created for discriminating consumers who seek contemporary fine furniture that is individual in personality, sustainable in origin. We believe that the growing movement toward local and sustainable products will make our tables a preferred choice for those who want unique furniture that not only achieves the balance of form and function, but does so without creating imbalance in the environment.",home goods brands,,Abubakar

This eventually extended to stores across Canada. As new opportunities arose, Cooper Brothers expanded their product range to include upholstered furniture, custom woodwork, window treatments and bed ensembles. 

84 years later we are pleased to say that we have continued the tradition of exceptional quality, excellent service, and creative craftsmanship. The Cooper Bros family has grown to 26 dedicated craftspeople whose skills range from upholstery, to refurbishing, to custom design. We have long since outgrown our small St. Patrick shop and now operate out of 1185 Roselawn Avenue.

We like to think Harold and Jo would be proud of what Cooper Brothers has become -  a recognized and respected brand within the high-end furnishing community. Though styles have changed over the years, the heart of our business remains the same: to deliver quality to our clients through unparalleled dedication to our craft. 

Since 1939, Cooper Brothers has been guided by a rather simple vision; to make an art out of quality and customization for our clients. Our pride is in impeccable craftsmanship and incomparable value, and most importantly, the culture of comfortable living. We encourage our clients to think about what comfortable living means to them.

The owner and primary author of the articles included in this blog is a 45 year veteran of the furniture industry. Jeff Frank's extensive furniture-related experience covers manufacturing, retail (both online and off), product design, cost analysis, construction, quality control, marketing and advertising and many other industry categories.

He has worked with both mass produced and custom made, imported and Made in America furniture products and raw material sources.

Jeff is thoroughly familiar with advertising and marketing strategies and scams. (How can you tell when a 50% off sale is real or fake?)

He can explain why warranties that seem to cover almost everything actually cover very little and why extended furniture warranties are never worth the additional cost.

Jeff has worked as a sales manager for a small furniture retailer and as a buyer for a major furniture retail chain. He has been a sales representative and consultant for both small and large furniture manufacturers.

Jeff is the co-inventor of two different lines of commercially successful furniture products and has been awarded 7 patents for new product designs.

He is also the author of more than 800 articles on various furniture topics.

The Insiders Guide To Furniture answers questions about sofas, loveseats, sleepers, sectionals, bedroom and dining room furniture, mattresses, office seating and more. It provides answers that are extremely detailed, but also simple to understand. It provides answers that salespeople can't or won't provide.

Our style is mid twentieth century French and American with an accent on metalwork. In addition to our current line we do take a limited number of commissions to reproduce classic twentieth century pieces as well as original designs submitted by designers.

Since it requires so many skilled hands to produce each piece our delivery times range from ten to twenty weeks. We endeavor to accurately estimate delivery time when each order is received. Client's special time constraints can sometimes be accommodated.
