Overview,,,
"You will be given Georgia state lobbyist registration data, including the individual lobbyist’s name and association/employer. The goal of this project is to locate the company email domain and general phone number for the association/employer and locate the email address and direct phone number/extension for the individual lobbyist. Please only use the official website for the association/employer to confirm information. Do not use any other website. If you are not certain about the information, it’s better to leave the field blank. Please do not guess or input information from other sources.",,,

Here are the step-by-step instructions:,,,
,,,
Examine the association/employer and individual lobbyist information. Note the address of the association/employer is listed after the company name - this may help inform which official website is the right one.,,,
"Using only the official website of the association/employer, try to find the company email domain for the association/employer (example: @aexp.com for American Express). Click around the website to locate a domain using CTRL-F, searching for “@”. Do not use the website url. Below is a non-exhaustive list of pages to check:",,,
