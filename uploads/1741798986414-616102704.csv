Each Silknsoak shower steamer is designed to last multiple showers, transforming steam into an immersive wellness ritual. With five signature relaxation collections, our scents are designed to match every mood—whether you need an energizing boost, a moment of calm, or deep breathing relief.  

As a proudly Canadian brand, Silknsoak is available in Sobeys, Le Germain Hotels, and expanding retail channels. We’ve been featured on Dans l'œil du dragon, Salut Bonjour, and recognized among the Top 3 brands for AWS Canada.  

Excitingly, we are in discussions for our first Costco Canada roadshow, expected to launch in fall 2025, bringing our shower steamers to even more homes. Additionally, we are actively engaging with Shoptalk USA as we explore new opportunities to expand into the U.S. market.  

Our commitment to sustainability and cruelty-free formulations ensures a guilt-free indulgence. We also collaborate with partners to offer white-label solutions, bringing high-quality shower steamers to new markets.  

At Silknsoak, we believe self-care should be effortless. Breathe in. Relax. Let the steam do the rest.",www.silknsoak.com,Melanie,Castaneda,Co founder,Canada,https://www.linkedin.com/in/melaniecastaneda?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app,mcastaneda@silknsoak.com,,Sharoon
