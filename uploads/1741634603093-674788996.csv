As a general contractor, cabinet maker, and outdoor enthusiast he spent a lot of his time filling gas powered machines and constantly spilling all over his expensive equipment. ​He thought, there must be a better way.​Four years later the first prototype was built out of wood, plastic, and any other materials a cabinet maker had lying around. He was ready to make it legit and decided to start a business.​Design, engineering, and testing took the better part of 4 more years to complete. ""In order to sleep at night, I needed to make sure the SureCan was safe and easy to use"", he said. The perseverance and hard work put in has definitely paid off because in 2014 he took his new product to the National Hardware Show in Las Vegas, NV. There the SureCan not only captured the interest of many national retailers but also won the Most Innovative New Product Award at the show, as well as a Retailers Choice Award. Soon after the SureCan was featured on the DIY Network's hit show ""I Want That"" and as a Top 100 Product for This Old House Magazine.​""I knew I had something unique and different in the fuel can market, but I was surprised at how much recognition it received!""​Now that the foundation had been laid the ground work began! Further product development and testing continued through 2014 and in Spring of 2015 the SureCan was ready for the stores. In just under one year SureCan was spreading the country and going international with its launch into the Canadian markets.​By this time the SureCan had caught the eye of 3 of the Sharks from ABC's ""Shark Tank"". At the STAFDA (Specialty Tools and Fasteners, Distributors Association) convention in Phoenix, AZ; Lori Greiner, Daymond John, and Kevin O'Leary were the key note speakers. The SureCan was presented on stage and was selected as the top product by all three Sharks and is now considered ""Shark Approved"". To add to this success the SureCan was also selected as a Silver Winner at the Edison Awards in New York City where 300 judges around the world voted on new innovative products.​""I have seen a lot miracles taken place to get SureCan where it is today"".​A cabinet maker had an idea saw the vision and made it happen.",,Address Not Avaliable,Abubakar

A need to escape the daily grind at a moment’s notice, to be unbounded by terrain and free to roam.We believe that time is too precious to spend it tracking-down and packing-up camping gear. We wanted a compact home on wheels, always ready for our next adventure. The teardrop trailer seemed like the right solution, but nothing on the market checked all our boxes.So, we designed and built our own.Co-founded by husband and wife duo, Chris & Jen Hudak, the Escapod mission was simple: build the best damn camper known to man - a teardrop trailer that’s gentle on the eyes, rugged enough for the craziest adventures, and suitable for year-round fun.Blending the concept of a sleeping pod with the thrill of an escapade, the Escapod name was formed. After fumbling our way through some napkin doodles, we refined & digitized the now-iconic “e” logo. In June 2016, Escapod was officially born when the first pods were built in our mom’s garage.Today, Escapod has grown into one of the most revered producers of teardrop trailers in the US. Operating in 20,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing space, Escapod has struck a balance between creating a quality handcrafted product and managing an operating efficiency that meets demand. We are proud to say that, throughout our tremendous growth, we are still a privately owned business.Our goal is to maximize our customer’s connection with the great outdoors by providing dependable, hand-built teardrop trailers that can be handed down for generations. Today, Escapod continues to build premium off-road teardrop trailers that enrich lives by delivering an uncompromised camping experience. Life’s demands may require you to change, but your adventure doesn’t have to.To learn more about how Escapod is different from others, visit our ""Why Escapod"" page.",,,Abubakar

The original seed of the company was planted when they created the “A-Z Guide”, which was a brief introductory guide to essential oils. This product became so popular that a store was created to manage the distribution of this guide and within no time, additional tools and resources were added to the mix. For example, several proprietary products led the way in the success of the company, such as “The Essential Life” which is an in-depth research book to oils and natural health. Over the last few years, we have been successful as we have gotten feedback and ideas from our customers working to build their essential oil businesses. We are grateful for this feedback because we want to help you make the world better as you share and use essential oils.We have realized the amazing impact that essential oils bring to the world. We became OIL LIFE in 2015 and our new goal is to become a resource to help anyone and everyone easily use and share the benefits of essential oils. This new name change helped us expand our reach even further as the use of oils continued to grow. We hope to inspire you to succeed as you use, share, teach and enjoy essential oils. While our name has changed, our focus has remained the same over the years. It is still our goal to serve as the best resource for essential oil education while encouraging the further growth of the overall oil industry.

Until someone finally said, ""Glassboards are really freaking boring."" And of course, they were right. Our boards looked just like everybody else's—and so did our offices. So we decided to do something about it.A FUSION OF AWESOMENESSWe took those boring glassboards and started looking for ways to make them less snooze-worthy. We started out by covering the metal backing with vinyl, giving the glassboards colored or textured backgrounds. But that wasn't good enough.Then Bill—our CEO and a pretty cool guy—started looking around and noticing that people were already printing stuff directly on the glass of these boards. It was boring stuff, like patient information forms for hospital rooms, but it sparked an idea. What if printed other stuff directly onto the glass? Fun, awesome, totally unique stuff?We combined that direct-to-glass printing capability with custom images and art, and we came up with a fusion of awesomeness that you can't get from other glassboard companies. And View Area was born.OUR GREEDY EMPLOYEESOnce we had our new idea totally operational, every person in our office wanted a piece of it. Those greedy suckers all wanted their own boards, so we started letting them design their own. Bill got his Storm Trooper board for all those important meetings. Nate got a photo of his favorite fishing spot as the backdrop for his creative brainstorming sessions.And we realized—this is what people need. So we brought it to you, to other small businesses just like us who are sick of the cookie-cutter, corporate look. We give you the ability to design your own glassboard, from board size to background image to company logo, so you can make your office space all your own.

Compact, yet powerful, the Tanto was designed for defense, representing strength, readiness, and skill. We aspire to craft modern tools that reflect these ideals, designed for the modern warrior-sleek, purposeful, and made to carry daily.Our icon represents both the parachute of the original warriors who wielded gravity blades and the cross section of the Tanto blade.

For me, there is a greater rush of excitement as I set the hook, hoping that the fish I am targeting is on the end of that line. As I’ve caught different species, I’ve learned how each behaves, how hard it fights, what baits or lures to use, and all the different colors that fish, even in the same species, come in. Hooked Pins was created to remember each fishing experience, whether it’s on a Saturday afternoon with a friend, a weeknight after work before dark, or a special excursion to a faraway place. On the days you get skunked, one of our pins placed on your hat or tackle bag is a reminder of what worked the last time. It’s a conversation starter that gives you the opportunity to tell your classic fishing story where you exaggerate exactly how big the fish really was. It’s a gift given to the new-found fishing buddy you made on your latest adventure. The logo of Hooked Pins is a Tiger Muskie, a usually sterile fish stocked here in Utah, where Hooked Pins is headquartered. I’ve never caught one, but it’s my goal in 2021. The Tiger Muskie makes a great logo for Hooked Pins because, for me, it symbolizes the thrill of fishing, the search for the species that eludes your hook. As I share my story with you, my hope is that Hooked Pins will create a community of people who share stories with each other of their fishing adventures and the fun they had together. You can follow my journey for the Muskie on my blog or social media. Share your story with us using #hookedpins.– Zach, Founder",,,Abubakar

We nailed it in the quality department by using glass instead of your typical whiteboard material, but it didn't take long to realize that they were still super boring. Our CEO, Bill, decided to find a way to print beautiful images on the back of these boards. He tried lots of different methods over time, and through his experimentation, he found the highest quality and brightest colors came from reverse printing on vinyl. Once Bill had the method for printing, our creative juices really got flowing. Calendars, planners, vision boards, fitness charts, sales boards… The list goes on and on! Our custom printing allows for any image you want to be printed onto ¼-inch thick, ultra-clear, tempered glass for a stunning art piece that will last longer and look better than any other glass print. About the Company Glassboard Studio is committed to making sure every customer is happy with their product.

Born on opposite sides of the Asian continent – Tao in China and Kyu in South Korea – these two dynamic women found a serendipitous connection that transcended borders and forged a unique friendship. Their journey began when their sons, both attending the same preschool, became fast friends. As expatriates navigating the complexities of raising children in a foreign land, Tao and Kyu discovered common ground in their shared experiences. Despite being born in their respective homelands, they found a sense of belonging and fulfillment in the United States, where diversity and cultural amalgamation are celebrated. Raising their children in an immersion environment brought its own set of challenges. However, amidst the cultural tapestry of San Francisco, Tao and Kyu discovered a shared passion that would eventually blossom into House of Clouds. United by a love for fashion and the joy of dressing their children in adorable outfits, they embarked on a journey to create a brand that not only reflected their personal style but also celebrated their cultural heritage. The idea of House of Clouds took root from decades long struggle of Tao finding suitable cultural attire for herself while she was completing her higher education in England and the United States. While Tao was able to travel to China freequently during her college years to get clothing custom made for her based on her own design, this luxurious and fun experience ended when she started to raise her own children in San Francisco. Work and difficulties of traveling with young children took away access to this unique experience, which then made Tao realize how difficult it is for expats to find quality access to their cultural attires outside their original homeland.
