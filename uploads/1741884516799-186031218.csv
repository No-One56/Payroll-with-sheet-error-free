We have a large range of stock including plastic and wire shopping baskets, shopping trolleys, wheel along trolley baskets and industry specific products such as Warehouse trolleys, Garden centre trolleys and even order picking trolleys. If we do not stock what you are after we will always try to source it elsewhere, if we cannot source it we will fabricate something for you to create your perfect trolley. The last 16 years have seen unprecedented shifts in the world of retail. Highstreets were dying in favour of large out of town retail parks, and very few people were shopping online. Now highstreets are on the up again with customers looking to shop locally and purchase more local produce. Convenience stores, delis, specialist cuisine and other independent retailers are reclaiming the empty shops, and working hard to establish themselves. With the Global Pandemic, we saw retail crash as shops were forced to shut and then reopen again but with strict rules. The pandemic had everyone very quiet for a while but with some community spirit and mutual support, the retail industry started to pick back up and we were there to continue to supply to those who needed it. By providing customers with high quality hand baskets or trolleys that perhaps are a different shape or feel from the standard, retailers establish their brand values from the moment the customers enter the store. Customers are more likely to fill a basket that feels strong and comfortable in their hand, than one that feels like it will not take the weight of their shopping. Also customers are more likely to return if they had a positive experience, and a trolley that is difficult to push or clumsy to manoeuvre around the store sits as a negative in their minds.",Najam

He embarked on a worldwide exploration in the hope of chancing upon an impeccable trim. When he landed in Istanbul, he heard whispers of the Sultan of close cuts. Rumour had it he gave the cleanest and smartest shaves in the world, with the simple flick of a blade. Ted found the legendary barbershop nestled down a backstreet and took a seat, putting his beard in the hands of a man wielding a double-edge sword.
He was then smothered with a hot towel and splashed with aftershave. When a flaming stick was waved around his face and his ears, he had this bright idea: he had to bring these dapper-dos with a side of thrill to London.

We started with curiosity for entrepreneurship and passion for fashion. We wanted to make a difference in men's fashion based on the philosophy that clothing is so much more than an element that keeps you warm. We believe that an outfit is a means with which one can make one's identity visible.
Nothing is as personal and unique as a tailor-made outfit in which you as a person are the starting point. We developed our own working method for this that forms the common thread in what we do: slow tailoring. This is the combination of personal design, authentic craftsmanship and modern innovations. Our tailors create your wedding suit, tailor-made suit and/or tailor-made shirt based on this slow tailoring principle.
We strive to create a place where men can discover their personal style in a casual atmosphere and at the same time make valuable connections. As entrepreneurs, we find nothing more inspiring than meeting (new) people. This keeps us moving.
We percieve discovering our customers' personal style as a journey in which we continuously ensure that the wardrobe is a reflection of their character and lifestyle.

We thought we could do better. This is how the blissful union between TENCEL™ and certified organic cotton Mellowood® came into being. Mellowood® is therefore only and exclusively available at Undiemeister. The benefits are premium quality and maximum durability, which is second to none.
Premium quality
Mellowood® is soft as silk, absorbs moisture quickly and dries quickly, is highly ventilated, is anti-bacterial, hardly pills or shrinks and retains its beautiful color even after washing. Organic cotton gives Mellowood® its firmness. Soft and firm makes for the most beautiful underwear.
Comparison to bamboo
We understand that bamboo is often compared to Mellowood®, but above you can see that this new fabric is the next step after bamboo, both in terms of quality and durability.
Why is Mellowood® maximally durable?
As previously mentioned, Mellowood is a combination of TENCEL™ and organic cotton. TENCEL™ is made by the Austrian company LENZING™, a worldwide forerunner in the sustainable production of textiles. TENCEL™ is available in the Modal and Lyocell variants. Undiemeister starts with TENCEL™ Modal, whereby 95% of the resources used to make the fibers are recycled. A giant step in sustainability, especially if you compare it to cotton or bamboo viscose. With Lyocell, the recycling goes all the way to 100%. Production of all TENCEL™ fibers (from cellulose) saves as much water and energy as possible and is CO2 neutral. De the raw materials (beech wood at Modal and eucalyptus wood at Lyocell) come from sustainably managed plantations and forests. The fibres are biodegradable and highly dyeable (low environmental impact). Organic cotton is grown without any agricultural toxins.
LENZING™ has laboratory tested and certified the unique blend of Mellowood®. Mellowood® is also registered as a trademark. We want to prevent non-sustainably produced substances, or substances of inferior quality",Najam

_________________________________________________________________________
Origin?The New Originals find their early beginnings in 2011, as a close group of friends running a blog to share and curate interests within fashion, design and music. TNO started making name in Amsterdam's nightlife scene by hosting parties at its infamous venues under the pseudonym TNO SoundSystem. Officially founded in 2015 by Rizky Lasahido, Maru Asmellash and Eben Badu, TNO has since then grown into a full fledged brand. ‘
Think out of the Box
The 9 Dots logo represents a box, referring to an old riddle. The puzzle proposes the challenge to connect all 9 Dots with 4 straight lines. To solve this puzzle, all one requires to do is ‘Think out of the Box', this has become the motto and spirit under which we operate!
What else?
The basis is and remains of course clothing but our creativity reaches far beyond. As a brand, we are deeply rooted in Amsterdam's cultural landscape. Grounded in its many components and disciplines such as art, music, fashion, nightlife and other areas of creative expression.
Our curriculum vitae runs deep. Besides the numerous collaborations with creatives, artists and musicians you may know us from our partnerships with cultural organisations and museums or whipping up and serving our own milkshakes as TNO Milkshake Farmers or of our own yearly music festival with our close friends Smib for SMIB X TNO Fest.",Najam

Herome has been a market and industry leader in hand and nail care for over 40 years now. While on holiday in England, the founder, Margreet van Roemburg, discovered how to treat and properly look after her weak nails. Following her discovery, she was so excited that she decided to further develop her revolutionary product and bring it to The Netherlands. She has now succeeded in becoming the market leader of natural nail care in the Netherlands and various other countries.
Herome's success
Our approach works. Our customers can trust us. We only sell high-quality products that speak for themselves. Herôme first focused solely on hand and nail care. However, the company soon saw other opportunities for the essential care of feet and eyes. We believe in thorough research and the fulfillment of delivering on what you promise with your products.
